                                I'm a software engineer who enjoys building applications that are both reliable behind the
                                scenes and intuitive for the people who use them. Since my six years at General Motors, I
                                have worked across the full stack, from modern web interfaces to backend services and enterprise data platforms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What I enjoy most about software development is solving complex problems, improving systems,
                                and continuously learning new technologies. Whether I'm developing APIs, building React applications,
                                or automating testing workflows, I strive to create solutions that are scalable, maintainable,
                                and deliver real value to users.
                            </p>

                                I'm especially interested in software architecture, developer productivity, and the ways
                                emerging technologies can help teams build better products.

                            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
                            <p>
                                My path into software engineering began at Indiana University, where I studied Informatics,
                                Computer Science, and Game Design. That blend of technical problem-solving and creative
                                thinking continues to influence how I approach development today. I later earned a Master
                                of Science in Software Development from Boston University to deepen my knowledge of software
                                engineering principles and modern development practices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Outside of work, I enjoy designing and developing games, exploring new technologies, running
                                with local groups, and staying involved in the Austin community. Whether I'm working on a
                                personal project or learning a new framework, I enjoy creating things that challenge me to
                                grow as both a developer and a problem solver.
