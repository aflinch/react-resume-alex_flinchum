                                I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer who loves bridging the gap between robust backend systems and
                                seamless user experiences. Over the last six years at General Motors, I've progressed from a
                                Frontend Software Developer to a Software Engineer II, managing core data platform services and
                                API integrations for hundreds of manufacturing plants. I specialize in Java, .NET, React, and GraphQL,
                                with a heavy focus on building test automation frameworks that ensure application stability at scale.

                                I hold an M.S. in Software Development from Boston University and a B.S. in Informatics
                                (with a minor in Computer Science and a cognate in Game Design) from Indiana University.
                                This unique background sparked a deep fascination with how complex systems are architected and how
                                users interact with them. Whether I'm mapping out clean software design patterns for an enterprise
                                API or exploring interactive mechanics in video game design, I love the challenge of turning
                                intricate logic into intuitive, high-performance digital experiences.
